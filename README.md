## Documentation
I created this game for my Interactive Media Development course at RIT. This was my first project assembled in Unity and was coded using C#. The sprites were hand drawn with ink on tracing papaer for Inktober. The purpose of the assignment was to utilize vector forces for controls and physics. I plan to return to this project at some point to flesh it out as a juicy, fully functional game with levels, upgrades, and more.
