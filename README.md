# FlockingPathing
## About
This is a simulation of flocking and path following behaviors of autonomous agents. Press 'C' to change camera angles and 'D' to enter debug mode. You can download the build [here](ProjectFiles/Builds/Flocking&Pathing.zip) if you would like to see it in action.
## Documentation
I created this simulation for my Interactive Media Development course at RIT. This simulation, written in C# for the Unity engine, utilizes cohesion, separation, and alignment to achieve autonomous flocking of a flock of sheep. The flock is guided via wandering, avoids obstacles via Reynold's aglorithm, and remains within bounds. There is also a cow which wanders while utilizing a simple path following algorithm. All behaviors utilize vector forces. Sheep and cow assets were downloaded from the Unity Asset Store and are linked below.
